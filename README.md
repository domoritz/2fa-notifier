# [2FA Notifier](https://2fanotifier.org/)

2FA Notifier is a web extension that notifies users
whether or not the sites they visit support 
two factor authentication (2FA).

It utilizes the data from the [twofactorauth.org](https://twofactorauth.org)
project to determine which sites do and do not support 2FA.

Contributions are gladly accepted, but the project is still under
active initial development. Please create an issue to share your
idea before investing time at the keyboard to make sure that your
PR will be accepted.
